Amelie Butler,"Representative-at-large, Treasurer","I've been kicking around here for just short of a year at this point, and I'd like to help keep the place running with more on-campus involvement.","I used to help run events at my high school, and that involved working with (some, we didn't have many resources) money that we'd budgeted. More generally, I think I've taken enough courses and been in contact with enough of my peers to have a pretty good sense for what does and doesn't work in the CS program from a student's perspective.","I've tinkered with programming since about 2019. I've been doing a lot of reading about game design and the like, and I'm hoping to keep chunking away at a game design project I've been playing with on and off for a while, but I'll try anything from web dev to data analysis at least once.",FALSE,amelie.png

I'm most fluent in Python, but I've also used Lua extensively, and I have some experience with most C-family languages. CS is my passion, my pride, and my joy: I am lucky to be able to pursue a field that I love. I find problem solving deeply satisfying, and computer science quenches that thirst so well.",FALSE,ethan.jpg
Muhammed Patel,"Event Coordinator, Social Representative, International Student Representative, Technology Officer","I am passionate about doing something outside my studies.

Pratham,"Representative-at-large, Treasurer, International Student Representative",I've been fairly active on the MUNCSS discord since I started university in 2020. I've asked my fair share of questions that get asked daily and now I also help in answering them. I want to be an executive to go beyond just answering questions in #mun-questions as I know enough about CS at MUN now to do that.,"I was an event manager/staff volunteer and graphics designer at an NGO in Bangladesh. I'm also the current mental health committee representative for Curtis House at Paton but it hasn't even been a month since I got elected. I'm acquainted with handling events onsite, helping plan events, and designing posters, certificates etc. ","I've been in CS for 2 years now, I'm a 3rd year CS student prepping for my CICS. Currently in Comp 3200, 3201 and 3401. CS is a broad field and while data crunching and visual computing is interesting to me, nothing tops my curiosity like AI does. The fact that we can type in letters to program behaviors that are as binary as ""0 or 1"" to as complex as humans is very intriguing.",FALSE,pratham.jpg
Ellodie Ha Soon,"Treasurer, Technology Officer","I aspire to become an executive for I would love to get more involved with the Computer Science society before graduating. In addition to participating in CompSci meetings and events, I want to contribute and help in achieving the society's objectives. Moreover, volunteering has motivated me to look for opportunities like this one to maximize my potential. I believe that it also aligns with my own personal values and interests as occupying an executive position will promote my learning as well as my personal and professional growth. It would be an honor for me to make a positive impact alongside people passionate about leading, fostering a sense of belonging and ensuring that the community has a good time and amazing university experience.","I strongly believe that my experience as President of Student Council and Sports House Captain in college will assist me in planning and organizing meetings and events. Having managed the financial activities of my family business, I have shouldered responsibilities and duties which relate to those of the Treasurer. An example of my accountability is when I was in charge of custom clothing orders with manufacturing companies for ""school leavers hoodies"" for about 300 persons as well as sportswear (T-shirts) for the entire school (~ 2000 count). With respect to the Technology Officer position, my internship at a start-up has provided me with much experience and technical skills in software and full-stack development (app implementation - web & native). Teaming up and co-working with other developers and engineers on side projects has helped me learn different technological infrastructures. My personal project of hosting websites might also be useful.","I have been in CS since four years ago. Keen on mathematics, I enjoy the intellectual and logical aspect of CS (e.g the computational power to overcome challenges with lines of code). The CS thinking process such as breaking down a problem into steps and coming up with solutions is satisfying and rewarding to me. Additionally, it is an innovative space where I can bring my vision to life while applying my creativity as well as collaborate with others to work on fun ideas.",FALSE,ellodie.jpeg
