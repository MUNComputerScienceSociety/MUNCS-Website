Why are you interested in becoming an executive?
</h2> <p class="whitespace-pre-line">I aspire to become an executive for I would love to get more involved with the Computer Science society before graduating. In addition to participating in CompSci meetings and events, I want to contribute and help in achieving the society&#39;s objectives. Moreover, volunteering has motivated me to look for opportunities like this one to maximize my potential. I believe that it also aligns with my own personal values and interests as occupying an executive position will promote my learning as well as my personal and professional growth. It would be an honor for me to make a positive impact alongside people passionate about leading, fostering a sense of belonging and ensuring that the community has a good time and amazing university experience.</p>   <h2 class="text-lg italic mt-2 opacity-80">
How long have you been in CS? What about CS interests you?
</h2> <p class="whitespace-pre-line">I have been in CS since four years ago. Keen on mathematics, I enjoy the intellectual and logical aspect of CS (e.g the computational power to overcome challenges with lines of code). The CS thinking process such as breaking down a problem into steps and coming up with solutions is satisfying and rewarding to me. Additionally, it is an innovative space where I can bring my vision to life while applying my creativity as well as collaborate with others to work on fun ideas.</p>   <h2 class="text-lg italic mt-2 opacity-80">
Have you had any preexisting experience that would assist you
									in the roles you are applying for?
</h2> <p class="whitespace-pre-line">I strongly believe that my experience as President of Student Council and Sports House Captain in college will assist me in planning and organizing meetings and events. Having managed the financial activities of my family business, I have shouldered responsibilities and duties which relate to those of the Treasurer. An example of my accountability is when I was in charge of custom clothing orders with manufacturing companies for &quot;school leavers hoodies&quot; for about 300 persons as well as sportswear (T-shirts) for the entire school (~ 2000 count). With respect to the Technology Officer position, my internship at a start-up has provided me with much experience and technical skills in software and full-stack development (app implementation - web &amp; native). Teaming up and co-working with other developers and engineers on side projects has helped me learn different technological infrastructures. My personal project of hosting websites might also be useful.</p>   <h2 class="text-lg italic mt-2 opacity-80">

How long have you been in CS? What about CS interests you?
</h2> <p class="whitespace-pre-line">I&#39;ve tinkered with programming since about 2019.

Have you had any preexisting experience that would assist you

CS is a broad field and while data crunching and visual computing is interesting to me, nothing tops my curiosity like AI does. The fact that we can type in letters to program behaviors that are as binary as &quot;0 or 1&quot; to as complex as humans is very intriguing.</p>   <h2 class="text-lg italic mt-2 opacity-80">
