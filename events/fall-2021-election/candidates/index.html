									Why are you interested in becoming an executive? / What would
									make you a good executive?
								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">Being on the executive would allow me to provide some consistency to the technology officer role. As a senior computer science student, I have experience with our computer science society before and during the pandemic. I have high-level experience in all of the requirements necessary for an effective technology officer and I have the drive to be a strong leader. I feel I could transition easily into this position and be a strong contributor to our society. 

One of the ways I&#39;ve contributed to society already is through contributing to our discord bot Automata, I built a plugin that provided a utility for students known as TodayAtMun. Allowing students to query their exam times, significant dates in the MUN calendar, and an automated channel providing the next date on the calendar. I developed this plugin in my free time because of my passion to help students as they navigate through their program, If elected technology officer I would like to escalate aspects of not only remote(discord, society website, etc) but in-person events like lans, talks, and other activities for the society.

I&#39;ve been an active member of society for all of my studies, albeit the last two years mostly being online, but I&#39;m always providing advice to all students when needed.</p>

						<h2 class="text-lg italic mt-2 opacity-80">
									How long have you been in CS for? / What about CS interests
									you?
								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">I&#39;m a fourth-year Computer Science student.

Computer Science interests me as it is always evolving. There are many aspects to Computer Science that it&#39;s always fascinating to study. My interests in computer science right now are, Machine Learning, Web development, and Algorithms.</p>

						<h2 class="text-lg italic mt-2 opacity-80">
									Have you had any preexisting experience that would assist you
									in the roles you are applying for?
								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">For the role of a technology officer, 

I&#39;ve worked with React and React Native, JS, back-end experience with Golang, C#, NodeJS, and Python flask. Experience with AWS, SAM, Lambda, Cognito, and various other AWS services.

Experience with many languages through studies, personal hobbies, and work experience.

Experience hosting and managing servers. Most computer science students are aware there is a server that the society hosts for MC. I would like to get this revamped and active again.</p>

								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">As a kid, I always dreamed of being the stereotypical *types aggressively* “I’m in.” hackerman. When I started CS last year, I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t still believe in that (just a little bit). What I discovered is that I could be creative and build things. Make things people would use (or absolutely despise); It’s up to you!</p>

My creative skills would definitely be an asset. I have been freelance writing for around five years, and I have several years of experience in drawing and graphic design. I have been looking to apply my skills to a more professional outlet, and this is the perfect opportunity!</p>

								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">I am a second-year undergraduate student and have declared my Major in Computer Science. Having been in love with computers since a very young age, it was probably my passion for sci-fi movies soaked in computers, which finally determined my choice of Computer Science. Computer Science interests me at multiple levels. Learning, along with the problem-solving aspect, seems rewarding to me. I find it to be a science of abstractions. How we perceive, understand and interact with the world is mediated by computers which I find exciting! I am particularly interested in the aspect of knowing how things work, and thus networks and applications interest me the most.</p>

I have also held the position of Research Assistant at the Sleep, Health and Wellness Lab in the Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland. In this capacity, apart from other responsibilities, I also prepared infographics for various social media platforms to create awareness on Breast cancer treatment and its recurrence.

									Why are you interested in becoming an executive? / What would

								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">Because, the MUN CS Society has always been of special importance to me.

Last year, when I was confused about whether I should apply to MUN or not, while browsing Memorial&#39;s website I found out about the MUN CS Discord Server. I immediately joined and after spending a week on the chat, asking questions and just feeling the vibe of the group I knew I had to join MUN. 

So, basically this Society is what actually made me take the leap and come to this uni. 

The atmosphere created by Madison Emshey, Mudkip, David Chicas, and all the other execs is almost unbelievably welcoming. They answer every single question no matter what it it is and they answer fast. I haven&#39;t seen a server as active as this.

Having such a deep connection with this society and CS in general, I have a lot of dreams for the future of this society. I want to contribute to the best of my capabilities so that MUN CS can become even more grand and open. I want students from all over Canada to wish to join this society because it is so much more enticing, valuable and straight up Cooler than the rest of the CS groups. This society is already thriving with liveliness and enthusiasm but I still wish to help encourage innovation and creativity here. I want to give capable, passionate students all the resources they need to make their ideas come to reality. Maybe the next Uber or GitHub gets developed here! 

I will strive to get close to these dreams every single second I am an executive here. I&#39;ve always dreamed of contributing at this scale but couldn&#39;t because my high school didn&#39;t have a CS club. But now, I feel like this is a wonderful opportunity to make that wish of mine come true.</p>

								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">Although, I&#39;ve been tinkering with computers since 2nd grade, I&#39;ve fully committed myself to CS since 8th grade (when I was 13). 

There are two things about CS that interest me the most: 

1. The versatility. While studying most subjects, the deeper you go into their study, the more restricted you become in terms of what you can do outside your specific field. CS, on the other hand, broadens your reach the more you learn about it. What I mean is, if a person masters making efficient, scalable and user-friendly software or developing new innovative algorithms, they have the ability to apply that knowledge to any field they want! You can make an app for the Medical industry and save lives! or you can make a data analysis program for a finance-related company (hedge funds) and make millions! The world is truly your oyster once you master CS.

2. The New-ness. Now, one might argue that CS is quite an old field but not as old as most of the other STEM subjects. It&#39;s still evolving, new developments are being made every day! CS keeps me on my toes all the time as there is always something new to learn or discover, that&#39;s what keeps me from getting bored with it and stay driven.</p>

								</h2><p class="whitespace-pre-line">During my high-school I have led web-development teams for 4 projects. We made websites for school events and also the school magazine.

I self-studied through Harvard&#39;s CS50x course on Edx and have also worked read a lot of CS-related books in my spare time. 

I am currently the community youth and communications manager for Earth2.0 at UC San Diego and also the community lead at OASIS, a project under Earth2.0

I can work in GitHub, Linux and Vim.
I have experience programming in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python, C/C++ and QBASIC.
I have used Mac OS, Windows and Linux-distros as my operating systems and can operate comfortably in any of them.

I also have done some small projects on my own, such as creating an integral solver/area finder of a quadratic where you put the values of “a”, “b” and “c” of a quadratic, and two x points, (x1 which is the upper bound and x2 which is the lower bound) then my program solves for the quadratic equation’s integral, and the area of the equation from the lower bound to the upper bound. 
I also created a back end of an e-diary app where you can create your password and username to log in later and write something on your e-diary/see what you have on your diary so far. This gets saved in a file for each user with the file name being the username of the user which means a new file will be automatically created for each user, and their data will be saved there.
