## About the candidates

From Christine Russell:

> Howdy y'all!  I'm here from Texas and will be a 3rd year Computer Science major next fall.  My goal as Vice President is to make the Computer Science Society more than just a social club.  Specifically I would like to start having career panels, where we invite local professionals with a background in Computer Science to come and speak to our members about how they got to the position they currently hold and see what advice they have for those of us interested in a similar career path.

> I ran a similar program with much success while I was Vice President and President of the society for my first degree/major at my alma mater (Lambda Alpha Epsilon at George Mason University).  We had professionals from the FBI, CIA and Department of Justice come out to answer students' questions like, "What was your first job out of college?", "What other positions have you held?", "Did you obtain any additional certifications beyond your degree?".

> It provides a great opportunity to not only pick their brains for career advice, but also to network with local professionals and learn about possible job opportunities that you might not have been aware of otherwise - companies or positions we might not know about as college students.

> My goal is to have at least one 3-member panel per semester and if this is something you'd like to see implemented in the society then I kindly ask for your vote for me, Christine Russell, for Vice President.

From Mark Stacey:

> Hi, my name is Mark Stacey, and I am a 4th year Computer Science student. I have been involved in the society for a few years now, and I am hoping to serve as Vice President during my last year here at MUN.

>Why should you vote for me? Because of my dedication to improving this society and this department. Both have improved in recent years, but we have a long way to go. A helpful and supportive student community is incredibly important for the success and well-being of CompSci undergraduates. I will to everything in my power to help achieve the following goals before I graduate:

> - Stable society with ample resources, and well-understood rules/procedures

> - Stable and useful infrastructure available for use to the student population (i.e. Society server and website. They already exist, but they could be made more useful)

> - Improved outreach efforts directed at first/second year students

> - Continuation of Youth Engagement Initiative, and a broadening of our goals to include undergrads

> Additionally, I hope to help solve whatever problems students face during the semester.

> About the Youth Engagement initiative, I have been heavily involved in this initiative from the start. However, I became busy with work, and unfortunately haven't had time to devote to it as of late. That will not be a problem next year, because I will not be working. I will work on this project during the summer to ensure the initiative is ready to proceed in the Fall.

From Scott Young:

> My name is Scott Young, I'm a student starting my 4th year in comp sci starting this fall, I am an honors student, and I've been socially involved with the society for about 2 years and want to become involved at a executive level. I am a face commonly seen in the senior lab and am always ready and willing to talk or help fellow students.

> If elected I'll do my best to represent the computer science students of memorial, and I'll raise any concerns I have, or any concerns students bring to me.

From Dean Massecar:

> Heading into 3rd year next fall, I felt I should get more involved with the society. Along with the other members, I will push for bettering the department. In addition, I believe we should have further social events than just Scotch Wednesday and mixers. For example, gaming nights (Super Smash Bros, anyone? Quake, perhaps.)

From Jarret Kolanko:

> Hi, my name is Jarret Kolanko. I am running for the position of Representative at Large. When I first began computer science at MUN, I had a great deal of difficulty. I went in with no prior experience, and struggled to find help when I needed it. It wasn't until last winter that I learned that the computer lab was a gathering of CS students, and an excellent place to find help. If elected, I hope to work towards helping provide newer CS students with information on how to get help with courses, as well as working to improve Computer Science at MUN in general. Thank you for your consideration.

From Bukunola Ladele:

>Hi, 
I am running for the Representative At Large. The computer science society has
grown immensely over the last couple of months. This is mainly due to the
Facebook group and mixer. While this is has proved extremely successful, it
leaves out a big part of the society who don't/can't attend these mixers.  My
goal if elected is to use my experience from working on several committees on
campus to work with other members of the executive and the society to come up
with ways to make these people feel part of the society. Also I would like to
see more practical based fourth year courses being offered. Vote for the change
you really want to see.
