# Game Development

[Gamedev NL](http://gamedevnl.org) and the MUN Computer Science Society are very proud to announce that we will be offering workshops focused on game development in Unity.

Unity is the most widely used game engine in the world right now. It’s particularly popular with smaller indie developers because of its relatively low barrier to entry.

## Workshop 1 - UI, Scene Creation, and Project Hierarchy

Our first workshop, _Unity Editor UI, Scene Creation, and Project Hierarchy_, will take place from _6-8pm_ on *Friday, October 26th* in the CS lab, *EN2036*.

This workshop will focus on familiarizing participants with the overall Unity editor, and will be run by Rob Lockyer of Avalon Holographics.

[Rob Lockyer](https://roblockyer.com/) is a software developer with nine years experience building 3D interactive experiences. He graduated from Memorial University in 2011 from the Computer Engineering program. He has worked on titles such as Second Chance Heroes, Madden and RBI Baseball. His first job after graduating was designing and building a level editor for a custom engine, since then he’s also had the pleasure of being paid to work in both Unity and UE4.
