Auto-updates

Changes made to this repository are reflected automatically on the site live. **Do not rewrite the history of this repository** or else you will be cuddled by [the most adorable of kittens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INscMGmhmX4). But seriously, don't mess with time.

Adding new course notes
-----------------------

To add notes (descriptions, resources, past assignments, etc.) for courses:

1. Create a new folder under `content/04-resources/02-courses/` named `x-x`, where `x` is the course number.
2. Create a new empty text file in the new folder called `x.md`, where `x` is the course number.
3. Fill this text file with what ever you see fit.

Is there a format, you ask? Well, yes, but it's Markdown (not much of a format). If you want a starting point or a good outline, see the [notes for COMP 2710](content/04-resources/02-courses/2710-2710/2710.md).
